    "\n",
    "-  The Challenge is for you to develop a machine learning model to predict suspected elder fraud in the digital payments space as described in Rule 4 of the attached Campus Analytics 2021 Challenge Rules document. Your machine learning model (“Solution”) must meet: (a) the Challenge Criteria, (b) follow the Challenge Instructions and Requirements, and (c) incorporate the Key Deliverables, each described in detail below.\n",

    "Deliverables\n",
    "Download the attached trainset dataset\n",
    "Download the attached testset dataset\n",
    "Download and read the attached Campus Analytics 2021 Challenge Rules document. This contains critical information about challenge deliverables, instructions, suggestions, judging criteria, and winner eligibility.\n",

    "# Build a classification model for predicting elder fraud in the digital payments space as described in Rule 4, which:\n",

    "- Handles missing variables\n",
    "- Maximizes the F1 score\n",
    "- Uses the given data set\n",
    "- Includes suitable encoding schemes\n",

    "The dataset provided on the Challenge page is synthetic. Conditional GAN (“CTGAN”) was used to generate the synthetic dataset for this Challenge. CTGAN is a neural network model that helps to detect the distributions for the dataset and tries to generate data records with similar distribution compared with the original datasets. It can deal with both continuous and categorical features.\n",

    "Challenge Instructions and Requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "When creating your Solution, you may use a novel combination of existing machine learning and/or statistical methods, or develop your own novel method in order to extract and/or represent thematic information from the data file.\n",
    "\n",
    "The output needs to include prediction of a target variable. Additionally, your Solution must meet the following requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "You must use Python 3.\n",
    "You must provide citations and sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",

    "Challenge Suggestions: You may use any clustering, dimensionality reduction, or other algorithm families. Please note that among other criteria, you will be evaluated on whether your selections of methods are appropriate for structured data.\n",

    "\n",
    "Very important note: Each solution received should ensure that the dataset_id is present in every record and arranged numerically in the same order as the testset_for_participants.csv file. The solution should also contain a column called ‘FRAUD_NONFRAUD’, which is the predicted class (either FRAUD or NONFRAUD); value of this column needs to be 0 (FRAUD) and 1 (NonFraud). If this is not the case, the submission will be automatically disqualified.\n",
