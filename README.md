# Wells-Fargo-Fraud-Detection
A project which came into action after coming across an interesting problem statement given by Wells Fargo. This is a classfication of data by detecting the fraudulency in the transactions of customers of Wells Fargo.
- **Data**:
Conditional GAN (“CTGAN”) was used to generate the synthetic dataset for this project. CTGAN is a neural network model that helps to detect the distributions for the dataset and tries to generate data records with similar distribution compared with the original datasets. It can deal with both continuous and categorical features.
